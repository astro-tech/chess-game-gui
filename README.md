### About the development:
The application was mainly built for learning purposes. This enabled me to gain experience with graphical user
interface using python with tkinter. It also helped me to learn about object-oriented programming and handling
files. Unfortunately during development I haven't mastered git, so it was developed locally without the powerful
tools of git and GitHub. This means that I added manually all the stages of development later when I published
this software. In the future of course I'm planning to use git from the start!
### How to deploy:
To run the game the following font type is required: Segoe UI Symbol (seguisym.ttf)
This is usually part of a standard Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 setup.
Please check if Character Map includes it, otherwise download it from the Internet and install.
### Game instructions (also included within the game):
Instructions:
To start the game, select from the 3 available window sizes below. If you select Load Game,
the previously selected number of player preference is also loaded. With selecting the New
Game option you have to chose between man-computer or man-man modes. Selecting the first one 
also prompts to chose the man's piece color. The single/dual player mode can be changed during 
gameplay, always taking effect from the next turn.
To select a piece, click on it with left mouse button, to deselect it, right click or hit Esc.
For castling, right click on the rook which will be involved in castling. Note that castling will not be
offered if the selected rook or it's king moved already.
The game supports special moves like en-passant or pawn promotion. If one of the pawn reaches 
8th rank, an option will be offered to replace it.
At any time during the game you can access New/Load/Save Game from File Menu.
The Options/Settings Menu let's you to change number of player and if the legal move squares
to be highlighted or not.
During gameplay there can be warning messages in case the king is left in check.
At the end the winner color or draw is displayed and a new game is offered.
